## Brief Description
This 2-day Workshop, conduted by [VLSI System Design], focuses on Phase-Locked Loop IC design using Open-Source Google-Skywater 130nm node. The workshop takes an intuitive approach to designing a simple PLL with extraordinarily little math and without diving into complex frequency domain analysis or control system theory. The tools used are Ngspice (for circuit simulation) and Magic (used to create layout design and for finding out parasitic capacitances). These tools were briefly covered. The workshop started with basic PLL concepts, spanning all the steps in the IC design flow - circuit design, simulation, layout, parasitics extraction, post layout simulation and finally. It also, briefly, included the use of the latest CARAVEL harness to make tapeouts.
